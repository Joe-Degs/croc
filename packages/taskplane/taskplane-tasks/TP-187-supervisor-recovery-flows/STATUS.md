### Step 1: Plan all three sub-fix designs
**Status:** ✅ Complete

> ⚠️ Plan-review checkpoint. Reviewer evaluates architectural choices.

- [x] #538 design sketched (drain hook location, supervisor_takeover semantics)
- [x] #539 design sketched (reconstruction logic, partial-state policy, multi-batch heuristic)
- [x] #540 design sketched (fallback location, optional tool-call summary format)
- [x] Drafts in Discoveries

#### Design #538 — mailbox drain + supervisor_takeover

**Drain hook location:**
- Add a new helper `drainAgentOutbox(stateRoot, batchId, agentId)` in `mailbox.ts` that synchronously moves all pending `*.msg.json` files from the agent's outbox to `outbox/processed/` (using the same rename-into-processed pattern as `ackOutboxMessage`). This prevents the supervisor from later being shown stale escalations/replies that were emitted by a now-dead worker.
- Call `drainAgentOutbox` synchronously at lane termination decision points:
  - **In `lane-runner.ts`**: at the no-progress kill path (line ~982) immediately before `return makeResult(... "failed" ...)`. Drain the worker agent's outbox.
  - **In `engine.ts`**: at the hard-fail path that constructs the failure outcome and emits the `task-failure` alert (around line 3008–3033). Drain via `resolveTaskWorkerAgentId` to find the worker's outbox.
- Best-effort: drain failures must not block lane termination (catch + log).

**Zombie-alert filter (the part operators actually see):**
- The on-disk outbox drain alone does not stop alerts already queued in the supervisor's pi message queue. Add a per-lane terminal-state filter at the supervisor-alert delivery boundary in `extension.ts`:
  - Maintain a `terminatedLanes: Map<number, number>` (laneNumber → terminatedAt epoch ms) and `terminatedAgents: Map<string, number>` (agentId → terminatedAt epoch ms) at supervisor-process scope.
  - Engine-worker emits a new IPC message `lane-terminated` with `{ laneNumber, agentId, batchId, terminatedAt }` whenever a lane reaches a terminal state (no-progress kill OR hard-fail).
  - In the `case "supervisor-alert":` handler (extension.ts:1170), before invoking `onSupervisorAlert`, check whether `alert.context.laneNumber`/`alert.context.agentId` is in the terminated map. If yes, drop the alert (log to stderr for diagnostics) instead of forwarding to `pi.sendUserMessage`. The check is presence-based (any termination record) — the timestamp is informational/diagnostic.
  - **Suppression lifecycle (per R001 plan-review feedback):**
    1. **Lane re-spawn** — when the engine re-allocates lane number N for a new task in a future wave, it emits `lane-respawned { laneNumber, agentId }` before that lane runs. Extension.ts removes the entry from the terminated maps. This is the natural unmute boundary: a fresh lane gets a fresh alert lifetime.
    2. **`orch_resume`** — `doOrchResume` clears both maps before launching the engine worker. After force-resume the supervisor MUST see new alerts.
    3. **New batch** — batch transitions to a new `batchId` clear both maps (new state-sync IPC carries a different batchId, supervisor wipes everything from the previous batch).
    4. **`supervisor_takeover`** — marks all currently-known active lanes as terminated. Combined with the pause signal, this drops the in-transit zombie alerts but leaves the maps in place. When the operator subsequently calls `orch_resume`, lifecycle rule #2 fires and clears the suppression so future alerts get through.
- This is the synchronous "drain" the operator perceives: zombie alerts get filtered before they reach pi's user-message queue, while legitimate alerts after recovery are not suppressed.

**`supervisor_takeover(reason)` tool semantics:**
- Registered alongside other `orch_*` tools in `extension.ts` (NOT in `agent-bridge-extension.ts` — that file is loaded into worker/reviewer/merger only). Therefore NOT added to `ENGINE_BRIDGE_TOOLS`.
- On invocation:
  1. **Pause the wave**: same code path as `orch_pause` — set `orchBatchState.pauseSignal.paused = true`, send `{type:"pause"}` to engine-worker.
  2. **Drain all per-agent alert queues**: clear in-memory terminated sets, mark ALL active agents as terminated (this filter suppresses any further alerts for the duration of takeover); also synchronously drain on-disk outboxes for all known agents in the current batch via the new helper.
  3. **Preserve worktrees + state**: do NOT call `executeAbort` or `deleteBatchState`. Worktrees, branches, and `.pi/batch-state.json` remain.
  4. Return a structured text result describing what was paused / drained / preserved and the recommended next steps (`orch_status`, `orch_resume`, `orch_abort` if escalation needed).
- Distinct from `orch_abort` because it does NOT delete state and does NOT kill sessions — it pauses + drains + parks for manual recovery.

**Supervisor template documentation (`templates/agents/supervisor.md`):**
- Add a section documenting `supervisor_takeover(reason: string)` semantics.
- Document the existing text-reply parser semantics that lane-runner.ts uses: `skip` / `let it fail` / `close` / `abort` / `stop` are CLOSE_DIRECTIVES only when they are short (< 30 chars) standalone replies (or prefixes followed by `:`, ` `, `.`, ` -`). Embedding them in longer text is treated as instructions.

#### Design #539 — resume reconstruction from disk (deterministic, validator-compliant, with fail-loud fallback)

**Background.** `executeAbort` calls `deleteBatchState(repoRoot)` so `.pi/batch-state.json` is gone after `orch_abort`. However, `.pi/runtime/<batchId>/` is NOT touched by abort: the per-batch registry, per-agent manifests, lane snapshots, and event logs all survive. Worktrees and branches also survive (preserved per the abort contract). The existing runtime artifacts are insufficient to recover wave topology, so reconstruction adds a single small new artifact (the wave plan) to make recovery deterministic and dependency-safe.

**Required engine-side change — wave-plan runtime artifact.**
- New helper in `persistence.ts`: `saveWavePlanRuntimeArtifact(stateRoot, batchId, wavePlan, baseBranch, orchBranch, mode, startedAt, totalWaves)` writes a small `.pi/runtime/<batchId>/batch-meta.json` capturing the wavePlan and the few non-recoverable scalars (baseBranch, orchBranch, mode, startedAt, totalWaves).
- Engine calls this helper once at "batch-start" (engine.ts:2313 area, immediately after `persistRuntimeState("batch-start", ...)`). The artifact is also re-written when the wave plan changes (segment expansion).
- Pure additive: existing batches without this file fail-loud; new batches gain reconstruction support.

**Entry point:** `resumeOrchBatch` in `resume.ts:1060`. After `loadBatchState(stateRoot)` returns null AND `force === true`, attempt reconstruction. If reconstruction fails for any reason in this strictness model, fall through to a clear fail-loud message that names the missing artifact.

**Reconstruction inputs (deterministic strictness):**
- **Required (every one of these must be present and parse, otherwise fail-loud):**
  - At least one batch directory under `.pi/runtime/`. Selection rule: directory mtime newest-first, tie-break lexicographically-largest name.
  - `registry.json` in that directory.
  - **`batch-meta.json`** (the new artifact) — contains wavePlan, baseBranch, orchBranch, mode, startedAt, totalWaves.
  - At least one agent `manifest.json` (worker role).
  - Each worker manifest's `cwd` (worktree path) still exists on disk.
- **Optional (best-effort, used to enrich rather than gate):**
  - `.pi/batch-history.json` entry for that batchId.
  - Lane snapshots `lanes/lane-N.json`.
  - `events.jsonl` per agent.

**Reconstruction output — a fully validator-compliant `PersistedBatchState`** built to satisfy every field checked by `validatePersistedState` (persistence.ts:485–1015):

*Top-level scalars:*
- `schemaVersion` = `BATCH_STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION` (current constant)
- `batchId` = directory name
- `phase` = `"stopped"` (existing force-resume flow promotes to `"paused"`)
- `baseBranch`, `orchBranch`, `mode` = from `batch-meta.json`
- `startedAt` = from `batch-meta.json`
- `endedAt` = `null`
- `updatedAt` = `Date.now()` (timestamp of reconstruction)
- `currentWaveIndex` = `0` (force-resume re-runs from current wave; reconciliation determines what's done)
- `totalWaves` = from `batch-meta.json`
- `totalTasks` / `succeededTasks` / `failedTasks` / `skippedTasks` / `blockedTasks` = computed from worker manifests; succeeded counts are conservative `0` (the reconciliation pass that already exists in `resumeOrchBatch` re-detects done tasks via `.DONE` markers)
- `lastError` = `null`

*Required arrays:*
- `wavePlan` = from `batch-meta.json` (preserves DAG topology faithfully — reviewer R003 issue resolved)
- `tasks[]` = one record per worker manifest with ALL required fields populated:
  - `taskId` (from manifest), `sessionName` (= manifest.agentId), `taskFolder` (from manifest.packet?.taskFolder, falling back to `""`), `exitReason` (= `""`), `status` (= `"pending"`), `laneNumber` (from manifest), `startedAt` (from manifest, or `null`), `endedAt` (= `null`), `doneFileFound` (= `false`)
  - Optional: `repoId`, `resolvedRepoId`, `packetRepoId`, `packetTaskPath`, `segmentIds` populated from manifest.packet when available
- `lanes[]` = aggregated by laneNumber from worker manifests with ALL required fields:
  - `laneId` (= `"lane-${laneNumber}"`), `worktreePath` (= manifest.cwd), `branch` (read via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` in worktree, or fall back to `<orchBranch>-lane-N` constructed name; if both fail → fail-loud), `laneSessionId` (= manifest.agentId minus `-worker` suffix), `laneNumber`, `taskIds` (array of taskIds for this lane)
  - Optional: `repoId`
- `mergeResults[]` = `[]` (force-resume re-runs merge phase as needed)
- `blockedTaskIds[]` = `[]`
- `errors[]` = `[]` (any reconstruction-warning notes go through `onNotify`, not into persisted errors)

*Required objects:*
- `resilience` = `{ resumeForced: true, retryCountByScope: {}, lastFailureClass: null, repairHistory: [] }`
- `diagnostics` = `{ taskExits: {}, batchCost: 0 }`

**Validation gate.** The reconstructed state is passed through `validatePersistedState`. If validation fails (which would indicate a bug in the reconstruction shape), the helper logs the exact error and falls through to fail-loud rather than ever persisting an invalid state.

**Pre-resume diagnostics.** The existing `runPreResumeDiagnostics` already validates worktree existence, branch presence, and orphan detection. Reconstruction is followed by the existing diagnostics gate — unchanged.

**Fail-loud fallback.** When ANY required artifact is missing/corrupt OR validation fails, emit a structured, actionable error via a new `messages.ts` helper `resumeNoStateAfterAbort(missingArtifact, batchId | null)`. The error names the missing artifact (e.g., "`.pi/runtime/<batchId>/batch-meta.json` not found", "worktree at `<path>` no longer exists") and recommends `orch_start <PROMPT.md>`. The existing generic `resumeNoState()` is kept for the truly-empty case.

**Multi-batch heuristic.** Multiple `.pi/runtime/<batchId>/` directories may exist. Selection: directory mtime newest-first; tie-break lex-largest name. Documented inline and in the resume `onNotify` output ("Reconstructing batch X (selected from N candidates by mtime)").

**API surface:**
- `persistence.ts`: new `saveWavePlanRuntimeArtifact(...)`, `loadWavePlanRuntimeArtifact(stateRoot, batchId): {...} | null`, `reconstructBatchStateFromRuntime(stateRoot: string): { state: PersistedBatchState; batchId: string; selectionNote: string } | { error: string }`.
- `messages.ts`: `resumeReconstructed(batchId, selectionNote)`, `resumeNoStateAfterAbort(missingArtifact, batchId)`.
- `resume.ts`: when `loadBatchState` returns null AND `force === true`, call `reconstructBatchStateFromRuntime`. On success: persist the reconstructed state via `saveBatchState` (so the rest of `resumeOrchBatch` proceeds with normal in-memory state) and emit `resumeReconstructed` notify. On failure: emit `resumeNoStateAfterAbort` and return idle.

**No types.ts changes** — reconstruction yields a state shape that already satisfies the existing schema.

#### Design #540 — non-empty reason + assistant_message fallback

**Worker prompt change (`templates/agents/task-worker.md`):**
- Find the existing `Never Narrate What You Plan To Do` / `If you are unsure how to proceed` section and add a hard MUST: "If you DO exit-with-no-progress, you MUST first emit a one-sentence assistant message stating the specific reason (what you tried, what failed, what you need). Empty/silent exits will be intercepted with the most-recent assistant_message used as a fallback reason."

**Lane-runner change (`lane-runner.ts:688`-712):**
- The exit-intercept callback receives `assistantMessage` (already the most recent assistant message at that turn). The current code sets `truncatedMsg = assistantMessage.slice(0, 500)`. If `assistantMessage` is empty (whitespace-only or zero-length), the alert payload says `Worker said: ""`.
- Fallback: when `assistantMessage.trim() === ""`, read the worker's `events.jsonl` (path = `eventsPath` already in scope; agent events appended via `appendAgentEvent`) and walk back to find the most recent `assistant_message` event with non-empty text. Use that as the message.
- If `events.jsonl` also yields nothing, fall back to a literal sentinel: `"(no assistant message captured — worker exited without producing visible output)"`.
- (Optional/deferred per Step-0 decision: tool-call summaries from #540C are NOT included in this iteration.)

**File-shape note:** `events.jsonl` is appended-line JSON. Each line is a JSON event with `type` and `payload`. `assistant_message` events are emitted by the agent host. Read the file backwards (or read fully and iterate from the end) to find the most recent one.

### Step 2: Implement #538 — mailbox drain + supervisor_takeover
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Synchronous mailbox drain at lane termination decision points (engine.ts hard-fail + lane-runner.ts no-progress kill)
- [x] `supervisor_takeover(reason)` tool registered in extension.ts (alongside `orch_*` tools, NOT in agent-bridge-extension.ts; NOT in ENGINE_BRIDGE_TOOLS)
- [x] Zombie-alert filter (terminatedLanes / terminatedAgents) wired into `case "supervisor-alert"` IPC handler in extension.ts with the lifecycle rules from the Step 1 design
- [x] `templates/agents/supervisor.md` documents the tool + text-reply parser semantics
- [x] Targeted tests pass

---

### Step 3: Implement #539 — resume reconstruction from disk
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] resume.ts force=true path reads from disk when in-memory state empty (via reconstructBatchStateFromRuntime)
- [x] Loud failure with documented error message when no on-disk state (resumeNoStateAfterAbort message helper)
- [x] Targeted integration test passes (full suite still green; dedicated test added in Step 5)
- [x] Multi-batch edge case handled (most recent wins by mtime, lex tiebreak, documented in selectionNote and inline)

---

### Step 4: Implement #540 — non-empty reason + fallback
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] templates/agents/task-worker.md requires non-empty exit-no-progress reason (new MANDATORY block under "CRITICAL: Do NOT Exit")
- [x] lane-runner.ts falls back to most-recent assistant_message when reason empty (events.jsonl walk-backward, with sentinel for the truly-silent case)
- [x] (Optional) Last 2–3 tool-call summaries included in alert payload — DEFERRED per Step-0 decision
- [x] Targeted test passes (existing 5.2 updated to track variable rename; full suite green)

---

### Step 5: Add tests
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] supervisor-recovery-flows.test.ts created (44 tests)
- [x] Coverage: mailbox drain, supervisor_takeover, resume reconstruction, worker-said fallback
- [x] Targeted run passes (full suite: 3540 pass / 0 fail / 1 skipped — was 3496 before TP-187)

---

### Step 6: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ✅ Complete

> ZERO test failures allowed. Code AND test reviews fire here (Level 3).

- [x] FULL fast suite passing (3551 pass / 0 fail / 1 skipped — +55 tests vs baseline 3496)
- [x] Integration suite passing (folded into the same fast suite invocation; no separate integration runner exists in this repo)
- [x] CLI smoke clean (`node bin/taskplane.mjs help` and `doctor` succeed; doctor's lane-worktree warnings about missing `.pi/` are pre-existing and not introduced by this task)
- [x] Code-review checkpoint at Step 6 — R007 APPROVE
- [x] Test-review checkpoint at Step 6 — the engine's `review_step` tool only supports plan/code review types in this lane; the same code review explicitly inspected the new tests and accepted them, so the test review is folded in. (Logged in Discoveries.)

---

### Step 7: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] CHANGELOG.md three Unreleased / Fixed entries (#538, #539, #540) plus a Unreleased / New entry for the supervisor_takeover tool (#538)
- [x] Discoveries logged

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Baseline test count: 3496 passing, 1 skipped, 0 failed (107 test files) | Captured | Step 0 |
| TP-186 merged (Order of Operations rule live in templates/agents/task-worker.md:281) | Confirmed | Step 0 |
| Optional #540C (tool-call summaries) — DEFERRED. Most-recent assistant_message fallback is the spec-required minimum and addresses the issue. Tool-call summaries can land in a follow-up if needed. | Decision | Step 0 |
| Branch is `task/henrylach-lane-1-20260506T230236` (lane worktree branch, not `main`). Treating as the lane worktree per orchestrated run. | Note | Step 0 |
| Issue #538 architecture: alerts emitted by lane-runner via `config.onSupervisorAlert` are forwarded to extension.ts via `supervisor-alert` IPC, then queued via `pi.sendUserMessage(...)`. Multiple iterations queue multiple alerts in supervisor's pi message queue. After lane termination they remain queued — the "3-5 zombie alerts" the operator sees. | Architecture | engine.ts/extension.ts |
| Issue #539 root cause: `orch_abort()` calls `executeAbort()` which calls `deleteBatchState()`. This wipes `.pi/batch-state.json`. Then `orch_resume(force=true)` runs `loadBatchState()` → null → returns with `resumeNoState()` error message. `.pi/batch-history.json` is preserved across abort and contains the most recent batch summary. | Architecture | abort.ts/resume.ts/persistence.ts |
| Issue #540 location: `lane-runner.ts:691-712` — alert payload includes `Worker said: "${truncatedMsg}"` where `truncatedMsg = assistantMessage.slice(0, 500)`. The fallback should occur if `assistantMessage` is empty/whitespace. | Architecture | lane-runner.ts |

## Blockers

*None — but ideally TP-186 ships first so the death-spiral is fixed before
this task's worker is exposed to it during long-running review cycles.*

---

## Notes

- Bundles three P1/P2 issues filed together with TP-186's P0 in the same
  failed-batch postmortem. They cluster: #538 and #540 surface during the
  death-spiral; #539 surfaces when operators reach for `orch_abort` to escape.
- After TP-186 ships and is validated, this task can run safely. Recommended
  release: v0.28.7 with TP-187 + TP-188 bundled (both depend on TP-186 being
  live in the worker spawn pipeline for safe execution).
