# TP-193: Code-quality formatter adoption — Status

**Current Step:** Step 5: Testing & Verification (final)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-10
**Review Level:** 0 (None)
**Review Counter:** 0
**Iteration:** 1
**Size:** S (mechanically L)

> **Hydration:** This task is a mechanical pass — STATUS.md tracks outcomes
> at the per-step level, not per-file.
>
> **Review Level 0:** No plan or code reviews fire. Reviewer-agent quality
> checks (typecheck/lint/format:check) MAY fire if reviewer is invoked
> during step transitions, but no formal review verdicts are required.
> The test suite is the correctness gate; operator coordination on the
> freeze window is the procedural gate.

### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] On `main` (lane worktree, fresh from TP-191 + TP-192 merges)
- [x] TP-191 + TP-192 confirmed merged (`npm run lint` exits 0; `npm run format:check` exits 0 trivially because formatter is currently disabled — see Discoveries note)
- [x] **Operator freeze-window confirmation captured in Discoveries** (pre-recorded in row already present)
- [x] Baseline test count recorded (3624 passing / 1 skipped / 0 failed; 3625 total)

---

### Step 1: Configure formatter rules in biome.json
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] `biome.json` formatter block updated per spec 6.3.1
- [x] `javascript.formatter` block updated per spec 6.3.1
- [x] `npm run format:check` reports many files needing formatting (175 files / 175 errors, sanity)
- [x] Commit: `chore(TP-193): configure Biome formatter rules`

---

### Step 2: Apply biome format --write across the codebase
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] `npm run format` applied (175 files formatted)
- [x] Sample diff inspection confirms purely mechanical changes (no logic)
- [x] Full fast suite passes (3624 pass / 1 skipped / 0 fail)
- [x] Single commit captures the format pass; SHA recorded in Discoveries (`f1d4533985e4853733d8f571920af8e2ac4a6cee`)
- [x] Commit message: `chore(TP-193): apply biome format --write to entire codebase (formatter adoption)`
- [x] Bonus: separate prep commit (`2c803c78`) made source-grep tests format-resilient (added `expect().toContainNormalized()` helper, bumped fixed-size source-slice windows, excluded test files from `tmux-reference-audit.mjs` strict-mode functional-usage detection)

---

### Step 3: Add .git-blame-ignore-revs
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] `.git-blame-ignore-revs` created with Step 2 commit SHA + explanatory comment
- [x] `git blame --ignore-revs-file=.git-blame-ignore-revs <file>` verified to skip the format commit
- [x] Commit: `chore(TP-193): add format-adoption commit to .git-blame-ignore-revs` (combined commit with Step 4 docs)

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] `docs/maintainers/development-setup.md` updated with `.git-blame-ignore-revs` setup section
- [x] CHANGELOG entry under [Unreleased] → Internal added
- [x] Discoveries logged below (file count: 161 source files reformatted; rule choices match spec 6.3.1; conflicts: see Discoveries rows for the test-resilience prep work)

---

### Step 5: Testing & Verification
**Status:** ✅ Complete

> ZERO test failures allowed.

- [x] FULL fast suite passes (3624 / 3625; 1 skipped, 0 fail)
- [x] FULL integration suite passes (`npm test` includes `*.integration.test.ts` and reports the same 3624/0 result)
- [x] `npm run format:check` exits 0 (`Checked 175 files. No fixes applied.`)
- [x] `npm run lint` exits 0 (TP-192 cleanup preserved; 277 warnings + 668 infos, 0 errors)
- [x] `npm run typecheck` count unchanged at **264 errors** (TP-192 baseline preserved — format pass introduced ZERO new type errors)
- [x] CLI smoke clean: `node bin/taskplane.mjs help` exits 0; `node bin/taskplane.mjs doctor` parses and runs (exits 1 only because the lane worktree is missing `.pi/agents/*.md` template files — environmental, not a TP-193 regression)

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Operator freeze-window pre-confirmation (2026-05-10)** | Step 0 unblocked | Supervisor verified no internal PRs in flight after TP-192 merge. The two open community PRs (#520 Nix CLI resolution by @chenxin-yan, #516 polyrepo by @loopyd DRAFT) are external forks; their rebase pain is the contributors' responsibility on their next update, not ours. Operator explicitly confirmed proceeding with TP-193 immediately after TP-192 merge. Step 0 freeze-window check should treat this row as the captured confirmation. |
| **Baseline metrics captured at Step 0** | Step 0 verified | `npm run lint` exits 0 (277 warnings + 660 infos, 0 errors — clean post TP-192). `npm run format:check` exits 0 trivially because `formatter.enabled: false` in current `biome.json` (biome reports `Checked 0 files`). The PROMPT's expectation that format:check would exit non-zero pre-Step-1 was inaccurate for biome 2.x — disabled formatter short-circuits to 0 instead of failing. Test baseline: 3625 tests / 3624 pass / 1 skipped / 0 fail. |
| **Format pass scope** | Step 2 verified | 175 files passed through Biome (`Formatted 175 files. Fixed 175 files.`); 161 of those produced a non-empty diff in git (the rest were already conformant or within whitespace-only equivalent). Total diff: +26,523 / -16,703 lines (mostly long-line vertical re-wrapping with `lineWidth: 100`). Format-pass commit SHA: `f1d4533985e4853733d8f571920af8e2ac4a6cee`. |
| **Brittle source-grep tests — test-resilience prep was unavoidable** | Resolved via prep commit `2c803c78` | The codebase has ~22 distinct `expect(source).toContain("literal-multi-token-substring")` assertions across ~20 test files that broke when the formatter wrapped `foo(a, b, c)` calls vertically into `foo(\n\ta,\n\tb,\n\tc,\n)`. Fixed by adding `toContainNormalized()` (whitespace + bracket-padding + trailing-comma normalization) and bumping a few fixed-size source-slice windows. The PROMPT's "format pass = mechanical only" rule made this a separate prep commit so `.git-blame-ignore-revs` cleanly targets only `f1d45339`. |
| **`tmux-reference-audit.mjs` strict-mode false positive after format** | Resolved in prep commit `2c803c78` | Biome's `quoteStyle: "double"` rule with smart-quote switching rewrote test assertions like `'execSync(\\'tmux list-sessions\\')'` to `"execSync('tmux list-sessions")` (outer single → outer double, removing the escapes that previously hid the substring from the audit's regex). Audit's `FUNCTIONAL_PATTERNS` regex then started matching 4 test-only assertions as if they were real TMUX execution. Fix: added `isTestSourceFile()` helper to the audit that skips strict-mode functional-usage detection inside `*.test.ts` / `tests/` files (these are negative assertions about production code, not actual TMUX calls). Reference counts under compat-code/comments-docs are unaffected. |
| **Rule choices match codebase conventions** | Step 1 verified | Tabs, double quotes, semicolons — all already in use throughout the codebase pre-TP-193. The format pass diff is dominated by line-wrapping (lineWidth: 100), trailing-comma insertion, and arrow-paren insertion (`x =>` → `(x) =>`). No convention changes. |

## Notes

**Operator coordination is the actual gating concern**, not technical complexity. The diff is mechanically simple (Biome generates it) but socially complex (every in-flight PR will need to rebase). Step 0's freeze-window check exists to prevent landing this task during active PR development.

**Freeze window protocol (per spec section 6.3.4):**
1. Operator announces a freeze 24h in advance.
2. All PRs at "ready to merge" are held — no new merges during the window.
3. TP-193 lands.
4. Held PRs rebase against the now-formatted main; Biome's formatter runs cleanly on rebased work, so the rebase is mechanical.
5. After TP-194 lands (the gate flip), `format:check` is required, and any new PR's format diff is a single review concern instead of an unbounded one.
